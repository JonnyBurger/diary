# Documentation of CI Jobs

## OpenSuse Build Service Nightly Builds from Master
`push` events on the `master` branch trigger a rebuild of the [`diary-nightly`](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:in0rdr/diary-nightly) package in the OpenSuse Build Service (see [./OBS.md](./OBS.md) for a description of the OBS builds).

These jobs are called "workflows" in the OpenSuse Build Service and they are stored at [`.obs/workflows.yml`](../.obs/workflows.yml).

The documentation for this kind of "workflow" can be found in the [GitHub repository of the Open Build Service](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/wiki/Better-SCM-CI-Integration) and in a [series of blog posts on "SCM integration"](https://openbuildservice.org/blog).

A new chapter in the documentation was written Nov 2021 which explains the purpose and usage of OBS workflows in detail:
https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/cha.obs.scm_ci_workflow_integration.html

### Create OBS Workflow Token

The `$token` is a 40 char [personal Git access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

A workflow token can be created as follows:
```bash
# https://openbuildservice.org/2021/05/31/scm-integration/
$ osc api -X POST "/person/in0rdr/token?project=home:in0rdr&package=diary-nightly&operation=workflow&scm_token=$token"
```

To list existing tokens, visit:
https://build.opensuse.org/my/tokens

Or list via CLI:
```bash
$ osc token list
```

The value of the token is configured on the VCS side.

## GitHub Action to Verify Build

[`.github/workflows/c.yml`](../.github/workflows/c.yml) implements a GitHub action to run the simple series of build steps (`make && make install`) for new commits and pull requests on the `master` branch.

[`.github/c/make-install/action.yml`](../.github/c/make-install/action.yml) is a re-usable action (dependency).

## GitHub Action to Render Man Page

[`.github/workflows/man.yml`](../.github/workflows/man.yml) is a job to render a new version of the man page after each commit or pull request on the `master` branch.

This file is consumed by a Terraform job and rendered at https://diary.in0rdr.ch/man.

A refresh of the html file in this GitHub repository does not automatically refresh the man page on the website (manual step).
